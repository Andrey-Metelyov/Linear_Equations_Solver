<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let's solve the problem with one additional variable and one additional equation. The variables would be <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>. In general this equation would look like this:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{cases} ax+by=c \\ dx + ey = f \end{cases}\)</span></p>

<p>Where <span class="math-tex">\(a, b, c, d, e, f\)</span> are numbers. The general algorithm is to separate the variables so that the first variable is solved in the first line and the second variable is solved in the second line.</p>

<p>The main concept here is to subtract rows. You already know how to subtract numbers and subtraction of rows is pretty similar. Below is an example in which we subtract the first row from the second one.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ dx - ax + ey - by = f - c \end{cases}\)</span></p>

<p>As you can see, we subtract <span class="math-tex">\(ax+by\)</span> from the left side of the second equation and also subtract <span class="math-tex">\(c\)</span> from the right side that equation. Since we subtracted equal amounts from both sides, the equation remains correct. You also can simplify this as shown below:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ (d-a)x + (e-b)y = f - c \end{cases}\)</span></p>

<p>However, this all comes together when you realize you can subtract only a part of an equation. Let's subtract the first equation multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\(d / a\)</span> from the second equation.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ (d-a * d/a)x + (e-b * d/a)y = f - c*d/a \end{cases}\)</span></p>

<p>Notice that <span class="math-tex">\(d - a *d / a\)</span> becomes <span class="math-tex">\(d - d\)</span> and becomes <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>. Therefore, we can exclude <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> from the second equation.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ (e-b * d/a)y = f - c*d/a \end{cases}\)</span></p>

<p>And there we can find the <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> value. Just divide both sides by <span class="math-tex">\(e - b * d / a\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{cases} ax+by = c \\ y = \dfrac{f - c*d/a}{(e-b * d/a)} \end{cases}\)</span></p>

<p>Now, you can find the <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> value from the first equation since you know the <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> value. This is a similar problem like in the previous stage.</p>

<p>The first line of the input contains numbers <span class="math-tex">\(a, b, c\)</span>. The second line of the input contains numbers <span class="math-tex">\(d, e, f\)</span>. All 6 numbers are doubles. You should output the solution: <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> in a single line.</p>
