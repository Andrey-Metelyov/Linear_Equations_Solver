<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A linear equation is an equation for a straight line, often presented as <span class="math-tex">\(y = a * x + b\)</span>. It is called linear because it contains only variables to the power of 1. The <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> above are these variables, while <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> are called coefficients.</p>

<p>Linear equations can be found in different fields of science and technology. You can find some basic examples <a target="_blank" href="https://sciencing.com/linear-equations-used-everyday-life-6022370.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>. In this project, you will write a lot more powerful solver, but in this stage, you will start with a simple one.</p>

<p>Write a program that solves the equation <span class="math-tex">\(a * x = b\)</span>.</p>

<p>Numbers <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(b\)</span> should be read from the first line of the standard input. You should output the value <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>, with which the equation is true. For example, if the input contains numbers <span class="math-tex">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span>, this means that you should interpret this as an equation <span class="math-tex">\(5 * x = 3\)</span>. For this example, the answer would be <span class="math-tex">\(0.6\)</span> since <span class="math-tex">\(5 * 0.6 = 3\)</span>.</p>
